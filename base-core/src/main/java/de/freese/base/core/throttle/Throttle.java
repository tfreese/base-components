/**
 * Interface f√ºr einen Rate-Limiter.<br>
 * <br>
 * As an example, imagine that we have a list of tasks to execute, but we don't want to submit more than 2 per second:
 *
 * <pre>
 * final Throttle rateLimiter = Throttle.create(2.0); // rate is "2 permits per second"
 *
 * void submitTasks(List<Runnable> tasks, Executor executor)
 * {
 *     for (Runnable task : tasks)
 *     {
 *         rateLimiter.acquire(); // may wait
 *         executor.execute(task);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * As another example, imagine that we produce a stream of data, and we want to cap it at 5kb per second. This could be accomplished by requiring a permit per
 * byte, and specifying a rate of 5000 permits per second:
 *
 * <pre>
 * final Throttle rateLimiter = Throttle.create(5000.0); // rate = 5000 permits per second
 *
 * void submitPacket(byte[] packet)
 * {
 *     rateLimiter.acquire(packet.length);
 *     networkService.send(packet);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * It is important to note that the number of permits requested <i>never</i> affects the throttling of the request itself (an invocation to
 * {@code acquire(1)}<br>
 * and an invocation to {@code acquire(1000)} will result in exactly the same throttling, if any), but it affects the throttling of the <i>next</i> request.<br>
 * I.e., if an expensive task arrives at an idle Throttle, it will be granted immediately, but it is the <i>next</i> request that will experience extra<br>
 * throttling, thus paying for the cost of the expensive task.<br>
