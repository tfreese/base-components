 * This class is to support reading CRLF terminated lines that contain only US-ASCII characters from an input stream. Provides functionality that is similar to
 * the deprecated <code>DataInputStream.readLine()</code>. Expected use is to read lines as String objects from a RFC822 stream. It is implemented as a
 * FilterInputStream, so one can just wrap this class around any input stream and read bytes from this filter.
